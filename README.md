# Luck-Game
The C++ project by Akash Nagaria is a luck testing game featuring player and match classes, file handling, graphical loading screen, game functionalities like pausing/resuming, and detailed player management, match statistics, and a hall of fame display.
Key Components:
Header Files and Preprocessor Directives:

The code includes several header files (<fstream.h>, <conio.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <dos.h>) and defines some macros (axb, hrk, kjw, kjwbl).
Classes Used:

match class: Manages match details such as the number of games, players, and current position.
player class: Represents player details including ID, name, scores, and match statistics.
Functions Used:

Various functions for loading, instructions display, profile management, game handling, player registration, and match management.
Issues and Recommendations:
Use of Deprecated Headers:

The use of <fstream.h>, <conio.h>, <dos.h> indicates that the code might be old or targeted for older compilers. Modern compilers might not support these headers directly.
Recommendation: Use <iostream>, <fstream>, and <chrono> for file and console operations instead of the older headers.
Unsafe Functions:

Functions like gets() used in player::modifyname() are unsafe as they can lead to buffer overflows.
Recommendation: Replace gets() with fgets() or use std::getline() for safer input handling.
Global Variables and Macros:

Global instances of m1, p1, pn are used extensively, which can lead to potential issues in large-scale projects.
Macros like #define axb textbackground(WHITE);textcolor(BLACK); are error-prone and can lead to unexpected behavior due to global changes in text color and background.
Recommendation: Refactor the code to reduce the use of global variables and macros. Use constants or enums instead of macros for defining constants.
File Handling Practices:

The code uses file streams (fstream) for reading and writing binary data (player.dat, match.dat).
Recommendation: Ensure robust error handling and proper file closure (close()) after use. Also, avoid using eof() for loop conditions as it may lead to unexpected behavior.
Input Validation and User Interface:

Input validation is minimal, especially in game choices and player registrations (checkempty()).
Recommendation: Implement more robust input validation and improve user interface interactions to provide clearer feedback to users.
Code Organization and Readability:

The code lacks comments and meaningful function names, making it challenging to understand its purpose and functionality.
Recommendation: Add comments to explain complex logic, refactor functions for clarity, and use meaningful variable and function names.
Compatibility and Modernization:

Ensure the code is compatible with modern C++ standards (C++11 and above) to leverage newer language features and improve performance and safety.
Recommendation: Update the code to use modern C++ practices, replace deprecated functions, and adhere to safer coding standards.
Conclusion:
The provided code is a comprehensive project but requires significant refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and robustness. Modernizing the codebase to eliminate deprecated features and improve coding practices will enhance its reliability and longevity.
